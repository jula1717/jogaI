# JogaI - Yoga Learning and Progress Tracking App
JogaI is a mobile application designed for Android devices, aimed at helping users learn yoga asanas and track their progress. The project primarily utilizes Java for its development, with some use of SQL and XML. Custom RecyclerViews have been implemented to visualize lists with items and track progress. The app's elements are programmed using adapters, and the list of asanas and their types is fetched from a database.

### 2) Detailed Asana View
By selecting an asana, users can access detailed information, including the type of asana, its name in both Polish and Sanskrit, its difficulty level, and whether it has been learned. Users can also view a graphical representation of the asana and, by clicking the "Description" icon, read a comprehensive description.
